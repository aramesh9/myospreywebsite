                <p class="text-muted text-left">Ospreys are a bird of many names! They are commonly referred to as “western ospreys,” “fish hawks,” “sea hawks,” and “river hawks.” As their many pseudonyms may suggest, these birds of prey are almost always associated with water bodies. They live and nest in close proximity to water, and the vast majority of their diet consists of fish. Read on to learn about the osprey.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">Ospreys are large birds of prey with sharp, hooked beaks, and long talons. Their wingspan can reach nearly 6 ft. across, and they weigh a little over 3 lbs. on average. Their feathers are brown, white, black, and grey.
                    They can easily be recognized in flight by their mottled wings, and five long wingtip feathers. Males and females are quite similar in appearance, and can only be distinguished by a few minor differences.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">These birds are found in temperate and tropical habitats across every continent on earth. Antarctica (where there are no temperate or tropical areas) is the only continent on which they cannot be found. Their favorite nesting sites will have easy access to open, shallow water, allowing them to hunt fish. They can be commonly found living near lakes, streams, marshes, swamps, rivers, oceans, and lagoons.
You can find these birds virtually anywhere that you can find bodies of water. In North America they are found from Newfoundland and Canada all the way down to Argentina. They are mostly absent from the very center of the United States and Mexico.
In Africa they are found anywhere south of the Sahara Desert. Their European populations run through Finland, Ireland, England, Scandinavia, Wales, and Scotland. In Australia there are patchy populations around the edges of the continent in close proximity to the ocean. Finally, these birds can be found across southern Asia, and a strip across the northern end of the continent just below the polar regions.

                <p class="text-muted text-left">These birds usually mate for life, but they have been recorded breeding with more than one mate. The female lays between two and four eggs in a large nest of sticks and branches. The eggs are incubated for a little over a month before hatching. Osprey chicks can fledge as early as eight weeks old. Once the chicks are three or four years old they hit sexual maturity, and can begin to breed.
